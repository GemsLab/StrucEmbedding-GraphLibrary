Description: # The Structural EMBedding library (SEMB)
        
        **Authors: GEMS Lab Team @ University of Michigan**
        
        This SEMB library allows fast onboarding to explore structural embedding of graph data using hetereogenous methods, with a unified API interface and a modular codebase enabling easy intergration of 3rd party methods and datasets.
        
        The library itself has already included a set of popular methods and datasets ready for use immediately.
        
        ## Extending SEMB
